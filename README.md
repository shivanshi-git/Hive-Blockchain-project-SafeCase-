#SafeCase
SafeCase is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Hive blockchain to provide secure, transparent, and tamper-proof management of digital assets, specifically images. It enables users to upload, edit, version, and authenticate images while maintaining an immutable history of changes. In an era where digital media can be easily manipulated, SafeCase ensures authenticity, ownership verification, and accountability.

#Key Features
1. Blockchain-Powered Transparency – Uses Hive blockchain to maintain an immutable record of image uploads and edits.
2. Decentralized Storage – Stores images securely on IPFS, ensuring tamper-proof access.
3. Version History Tracking – Every image edit is stored as a unique version with metadata, allowing users to track changes and verify authenticity.
4.Search & Tagging – Easily search and explore images using blockchain-based metadata tags.
5.Intuitive UI/UX – A clean, user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
